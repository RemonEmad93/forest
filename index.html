                    <h2>Lion</h2> 
                    <p>The lion, often referred to as the "king of the jungle," is a majestic and powerful wild animal that inhabits grasslands, savannas, 
                        and open woodlands of Africa. Recognized for its golden mane and muscular build, the lion symbolizes strength and courage. 
                        Lions are known for their social behavior, living in groups called prides. These prides consist of related females and their offspring, 
                        along with a few dominant males. With their impressive hunting skills and cooperative tactics, lions are apex predators, 
                        preying on a variety of ungulates. Their roaring calls can be heard across the African plains, marking territory and asserting their dominance 
                        within their habitat.

                        Snakes are a diverse group of reptiles found on every continent except Antarctica. With a wide range of species, 
                        snakes vary greatly in size, color, and behavior. These legless creatures play vital roles in ecosystems as both predators and prey. 
                        Snakes use various methods to capture and consume their food, such as constriction or venomous bites. While some snake species are harmless, 
                        others possess potent venoms that can immobilize or kill their prey. Snakes' unique adaptations, from their heat-sensing pits to their incredible 
                        flexibility, showcase their incredible evolutionary success. However, due to misconceptions and fears, many snake populations face threats from habitat 
                        destruction and human persecution.

                    <p>
                        The tiger, a symbol of both grace and ferocity, roams the forests and grasslands of Asia. Known for its distinctive orange coat 
                        with dark stripes, the tiger is the largest cat species in the world. Solitary and stealthy hunters, tigers possess a remarkable 
                        ability to stalk and ambush their prey, which includes various deer and wild boar species. Unfortunately, tigers are also among the most 
                        endangered species due to habitat loss and poaching for their valuable body parts. Conservation efforts are crucial to ensure the survival 
                        of these magnificent creatures and maintain the delicate balance of their ecosystems.
